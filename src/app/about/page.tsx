            In a world with quick, subjective experiences, there is an objective strength in a language that is built from layers of intention and movement. One obvious example may be the visual arts, but expression is not limited to a specific medium; anything could be a linguistic vehicle, even the way that a room gets cleaned with care. When you continuously develop your own way of expression through a highly curated practice, you wield your own language with the most amount of honesty, freedom, and trust. Every experience is an opportunity to develop a purer expression.
            <br /> <br /> But where does it end? When is it complete? It never is. Layers can always be added, there can always be more, and that might sound like a never-ending nightmare, but is life all about the convenience? What is a body for if not for the experience? What is our time for if not to live it to the fullest?
